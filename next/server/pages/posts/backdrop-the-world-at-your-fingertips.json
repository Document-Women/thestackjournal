No, we are not talking about the large canvas that you hang to make your photographs stand out. Backdrop is a travel companion and travel discovery app for people who are adventurous and curious about the world. With the backdrop app, users can discover thousands of aesthetically pleasing places based on their choice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Timi Ajiboye went to two of the smartest women in his life, Odunayo Eweniyi and Damilola Odufuwa, about creating the backdrop app, they knew it had to be more than an app that connects you to pretty places to take pretty pictures when you travel. In February 2020, they assembled a team of remarkable iOS and backend developers, product designers, project managers and photo researchers to bring the vision to life: an app that connects users to the best backdrops for their travel photographs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey content creators, what a time to be alive, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Travel enthusiasts, content creators, photographers especially travel photographers, travellers and anyone with a sense of adventure can now access thousands of backdrops at the tips of their fingers. Timi, Odun and Dami have built more than an app, they have created a community for like-minded people where users can connect to backdrops based on aesthetics  of their choice, from minimalist to rustic to vintage and so on; where users can find all they need to know about the backdrop of their choice; where users can plan their experience easily from the moment they start making their travel plans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the backdrop app, you can find places worth visiting in your location or while on a vacation. One of the best features of this app is that users can also upload found backdrops for other users and this gives them a chance to earn redeemable points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time to take that trip.</p>\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"What Does it Mean to Be a Customer Support Manager?
