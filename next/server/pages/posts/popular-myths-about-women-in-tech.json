Unfortunately, despite women’s contributions and involvement in the tech space, some misconceptions and stereotypes have prevented them from making progress or even entering the industry. Debunking these myths is important for us to promote gender equality and discover various talents that can help shape the future of technology. We will also be able to recognise women’s unique specialities that can create more opportunities and possibilities in the tech space&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are common myths about women in tech are:-</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Women Are Not Interested In Tech </strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, there has been a misconception that Tech is solely for men and women lack interest in it. However, this belief holds no merit as many women are curious and passionate about technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Women Lack The Skills Needed For Technical Roles</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252435881/Almost-half-of-young-women-dont-feel-they-have-the-skills-for-a-tech-career\">study</a> done by Tech City UK, 45% of young women don’t feel like they have the skills to work in the tech space, and 38% claimed to “lack knowledge” about technology. The misconception that women lack the skills to succeed in tech roles and are not naturally fit for tech is nothing but a fallacy. Women possess the same level of competence as men in acquiring the necessary skills required for tech jobs. There are many opportunities in the industry, and women are not limited to any particular role. It is important for them to consider different choices and follow a career path that aligns with their passions and abilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Women are not suitable for leadership roles in tech.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.strongdm.com/blog/women-in-tech-statistics#:~:text=1.,a%20woman%20serving%20as%20CEO.\">17%</a> of technology companies currently have a woman serving as CEO.&nbsp; Studies have also shown that women possess the necessary skills and expertise to thrive in leadership positions within the technology industry, and promoting diversity in leadership can lead to fresh viewpoints and approaches that result in significant achievements. By fostering a work environment that recognises and promotes diversity in leadership roles, we can establish an atmosphere where women feel motivated to pursue leadership opportunities and fulfil their potential. So when choosing leaders, ability and expertise should be the primary criteria, not gender.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Women cannot balance their careers with family life</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a very common occurrence for women leaders and women in tech to be asked about how they balance their careers with their personal lives, whereas men are hardly ever asked this question. The ability to achieve a work-life balance isn&#8217;t determined by gender, as both men and women face the same challenges. Many women have successfully balanced their personal lives and careers together, and they do this by effectively managing their time and being resilient.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>To pursue a tech career, women need to have proficiency in math and coding.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I was told this misleading stereotype before I entered the tech industry. As someone who didn&#8217;t like math, I was too scared to pursue a career in tech. However, over time, I realised that while having a solid foundation in math and coding can be beneficial in some tech careers, many other roles in the tech field don&#8217;t necessarily need one to have knowledge in math or coding to succeed in this industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Women are only hired to meet quotas</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement that “Women are hired only to meet diversity quotas” is both discriminatory and inaccurate. It undervalues the skills and qualifications of women in their workplace and disregards their contributions. Rather than make assumptions about the reasons for hiring, we should focus on creating a workplace that values the talents of each employee, irrespective of their gender.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope we can learn to prioritise diversity in the tech industry, especially because women bring technical skills that are just as valuable as their male colleagues, not to mention getting fresh perspectives that can add value to the field. We should also create opportunities for them to pursue their tech careers while also empowering them to achieve their goals. This is an approach that will not only benefit women but also the tech industry as a whole.</p>\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Tech Sales vs Business Development","excerpt":"<p>Tech sales and Business development are important for generating revenue for companies in the tech industry.
