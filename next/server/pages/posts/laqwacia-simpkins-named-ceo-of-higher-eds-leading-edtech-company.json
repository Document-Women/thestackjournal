Previously, she worked as AMSA&#8217;s vice president of infrastructure and operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laqwacia applied her experience in the startup industry to develop the current business model, which resulted in the introduction of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://amsaconnect.com/\">AMSA Connect</a>&nbsp;platform. Her efforts to gather market data, grow the company, and improve operations breathed new life into the AMSA name.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laqwacia spearheaded AMSA&#8217;s new chapter of growth and success, bringing in over twenty new clients in the first year by spotting opportunities and establishing strategic connections in the Higher Education industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of her foresight and AMSA&#8217;s affiliation with former NFL linebacker and AMSA founder&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maurice-simpkins-66658716\">Maurice Simpkins</a>, the organisation has formalized agreements with EdTech companies, including Coursedog, Unimarket, and Transact Payments (Cashnet). In this way, he could devote more time to expanding the platform while Laqwacia worked to expand the company&#8217;s roster of clients and business alliances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laqwacia plans to enlarge AMSA&#8217;s staff to accommodate the company&#8217;s expansion and further her goal. The Chief Technology Officer of AMSA will be taken over by Nebi Hailermariam, who has served as Software Development Director since 2016. Nebi will be in charge of the AMSA Connect platform&#8217;s client features and operations under the supervision of Maurice Simpkins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, Jason Cox will take on the role of National Sales Manager after serving in a similar capacity at EdTech startup CampusLogics. Ro Levy, who has been with AMSA since the company&#8217;s inception in the early part of 2018, has been promoted to the position of Project Manager Lead for Partnership Engagements, while Shahab Shahabi will lead the Project Management for Internal and Client Deployment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A.M. Simpkins &amp; Associates has always been shaped by Maurice&#8217;s NFL football background. Laqwacia remarked, “The AMSA Team is excited to have a new Head Coach to lead them during this Super Bowl-winning season. This is an exciting time for AMSA and Laqwacia has been primed for this role. There is no greater time to have her lead the company and I’m personally proud that our daughters will get to see her embody the role that we hope they all aspire to someday. Laqwacia has been groomed for this post during a pivotal juncture in AMSA&#8217;s history. There&#8217;s no better time for her to take the helm at the company, and I&#8217;m thrilled that our daughters will have the opportunity to watch her model the kind of leadership we&#8217;re raising them to pursue.&#8221;</p>\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Rose-Margaret Ekeng-Itua has become the first black woman to hold a PhD in Cybernetics","excerpt":"<p>An award-winning Nigerian Professor, Rose-Margaret Ekeng-Itua, has emerged as the first black woman in the world to earn a doctorate (PhD) in Cybernetics, which is the scientific study of control and communication in animals and machines, concerned with understanding complex systems like learning, cognition, adaptation, emergence, communication, and efficiency.
