While both of them play the same role of contributing to the company’s growth, they do it in a different way and timeframe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tech sales focus on closing deals with different customers, while business development creates new business opportunities for the company through partnerships, identifying new market opportunities, and nurturing long-term relationships with potential clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tech sales success is measured by meeting sales quotas and generating revenue in a specific timeframe, while business development creates long-term value for the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another notable difference is that tech salespeople spend a significant amount of time directly interacting with potential customers to sell technology products or services to them. To do this, they must understand customer needs, showcase product features, and close deals to generate more revenue. However, for business development, their main focus is building relationships with potential clients, conducting research, attending industry events, or even creating sales presentations for new audiences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tech sales require good communication, persuasion, and negotiation skills. They also need to understand the tech products or services sold while building a good rapport with customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, business development requires excellent relationship-building and networking skills, strategic thinking, and market analysis abilities. They must also be able to identify and assess potential partnerships and business opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, tech sales convert leads into customers and generate revenue for the company, while business development creates the foundation for future growth by finding new opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Everything you need to know about Product Management ","excerpt":"<p>Product Management is a key function in any business that wants to create and launch successful products.</p>\n","slug":"everything-you-need-to-know-about-product-management","date":"2024-04-16T20:02:39","categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Essays","slug":"essays"}}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://wp.thestackjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jason-goodman-Oalh2MojUuk-unsplash-scaled.jpg"}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Miracle Okah","firstName":"Miracle","lastName":"Okah","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cebae8fde05b50de4eb6952005c1da27?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}}}}},{"node":{"title":"Web Development 101: Front-End vs. Back-End Explained","excerpt":"<p>If front-end development is the application’s face, then the back-end is the brain.</p>\n","slug":"web-development-101-front-end-vs-back-end-explained-2","date":"2024-04-16T19:30:56","categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Essays","slug":"essays"}}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://wp.thestackjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fotis-fotopoulos-DuHKoV44prg-unsplash-scaled.jpg"}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Miracle Okah","firstName":"Miracle","lastName":"Okah","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cebae8fde05b50de4eb6952005c1da27?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}}}}},{"node":{"title":"Popular Myths about Women in Tech","excerpt":"<p>Statistics have shown us that the female gender is still under-represented, hence the reason why we must advocate for more women in the industry to create a balance. </p>\n","slug":"popular-myths-about-women-in-tech","date":"2024-04-02T09:10:10","categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Essays","slug":"essays"}}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://wp.thestackjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/close-up-woman-being-surprised-scaled.jpg"}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Miracle Okah","firstName":"Miracle","lastName":"Okah","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cebae8fde05b50de4eb6952005c1da27?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}}}}}]},"latest":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Startup Spotlight – Kola Market","excerpt":"<p>They help small and medium-sized businesses to drive sales all year round, increase their profits and grow sustainably.</p>\n","slug":"startup-spotlight-kola-market","date":"2024-05-08T08:05:38","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://wp.thestackjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/274AC94E-2155-4C6E-9B08-EA8D4977C203.jpg"}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Miracle Okah","firstName":"Miracle","lastName":"Okah","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cebae8fde05b50de4eb6952005c1da27?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}}},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Startups","slug":"startups","categoryId":5}}]},"tags":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Female-founder"}},{"node":{"name":"Founder"}},{"node":{"name":"Startup"}}]}}},{"node":{"title":"Meet Olajumoke Oduwole: Founder of KJK Africa ","excerpt":"<p>She has been trained in entrepreneurship and business management in nine top-notch accelerator programs and enterprise development centres in Africa and Europe.</p>\n","slug":"women-in-tech-olajumoke-oduwole","date":"2024-05-08T07:58:40","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://wp.thestackjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EDA185BF-30ED-418A-826C-07B542D1A034.jpg"}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Miracle Okah","firstName":"Miracle","lastName":"Okah","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cebae8fde05b50de4eb6952005c1da27?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}}},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Founders","slug":"founders","categoryId":4}}]},"tags":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Female-founder"}},{"node":{"name":"Founder"}},{"node":{"name":"Startup"}}]}}},{"node":{"title":"Rose-Margaret Ekeng-Itua has become the first black woman to hold a PhD in Cybernetics","excerpt":"<p>An award-winning Nigerian Professor, Rose-Margaret Ekeng-Itua, has emerged as the first black woman in the world to earn a doctorate (PhD) in Cybernetics, which is the scientific study of control and communication in animals and machines, concerned with understanding complex systems like learning, cognition, adaptation, emergence, communication, and efficiency.
