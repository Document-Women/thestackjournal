Back-end? We hear these terms in tech talk but what are they? These two types of web development are important and are needed to build a website or an application.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Front-end development is the creation of websites and applications, it is what users see and interact with; this includes visual elements like buttons, images, etc. Front-end deals with how the webpage will look, it is the face of the website. It is also called the client&#8217;s side because it is what users will interact with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main responsibility of the Front-End Developer is to build a good user interface to ensure that visitors can interact with the websites easily. When it comes to development tools and <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/whats-the-difference-between-frontend-and-backend/\">languages</a>, Front-end developers use tools like Express, Angular, jQuery, Django, and SASS. Their basic languages are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be a successful Front-end developer, you must be creative and have good problem-solving, communication and attention to detail skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If front-end development is the application’s face, then the back-end is the brain. The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-frontend-and-backend/\">Back-end</a>, which is also called the server side, is the behind-the-scenes of the website, they are the database server and infrastructure that makes the application function. They focus on what users can&#8217;t see and ensure that the website functions properly and effectively. The Job of a back-end developer is to create, maintain, and debug the entire back-end of an application. They write codes to develop a functional web application. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like the front end, Back-end also has its development tools like Node.js, MongoDB, Flask, and PostgreSQL and uses languages like Python, Java, PHP, SQL, Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be a good back-end developer, you must have good problem-solving, time management, and communication skills to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both front-end and back-end play important roles in the development phase, and one cannot function without the other. <br>The first step to becoming a developer is to gain more knowledge about it and improve your development skills. You can do this by taking <a href=\"https://documentwomen.com/top-8-online-learning-platforms-perfect-for-women-in-tech\">online</a> courses or getting a degree. Get certified, if possible, then you can now start working on projects, building your portfolio and networking with like-minded people who will aid your growth and guide you in your career.</p>\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Tech Sales vs Business Development","excerpt":"<p>Tech sales and Business development are important for generating revenue for companies in the tech industry.
