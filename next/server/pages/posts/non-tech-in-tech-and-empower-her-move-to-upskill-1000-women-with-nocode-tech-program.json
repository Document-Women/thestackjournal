NTIT grooms fellows in non-technical skills and matches them with possible job opportunities hence the partnership to empower as many women as possible in line with the vision of EHC”.</p>\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Female-Focused Fintech, Herconomy, Hits $300,000 In Seed Funding Round","excerpt":"<p>Herconomy was founded by Ife Durosinmi-Etti and originally started as a community of women in finance known as AGS Tribe.</p>\n","slug":"female-focused-fintech-herconomy-hits-300000-in-seed-funding-round","date":"2022-10-17T12:00:00","categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"News","slug":"news"}}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://wp.thestackjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/t4k6dwbojrivj493xgkz.jpg"}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Angel Nduka-Nwosu","firstName":"Angel","lastName":"Nduka-Nwosu","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e1371ceebf02f5c6454b48fbb73013d1?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}}}}},{"node":{"title":"Bukky Ojeifo Declared New Twitter’s Global Head Of Culture And Community","excerpt":"<p>Bukky Ojeifo has replaced God-is Rivera as Twitter&#8217;s worldwide head of culture and community.</p>\n","slug":"bukky-ojeifo-declared-new-twitters-global-head-of-culture-and-community","date":"2022-09-30T12:00:00","categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"News","slug":"news"}}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://wp.thestackjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/wvgvpuxsyfwdlibkregh.jpg"}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Azeezat Okunlola","firstName":"Azeezat","lastName":"Okunlola","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/079ea4adbf2e9ac4cba45a339bae0707?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}}}}}]},"latest":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Startup Spotlight – Kola Market","excerpt":"<p>They help small and medium-sized businesses to drive sales all year round, increase their profits and grow sustainably.</p>\n","slug":"startup-spotlight-kola-market","date":"2024-05-08T08:05:38","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://wp.thestackjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/274AC94E-2155-4C6E-9B08-EA8D4977C203.jpg"}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Miracle Okah","firstName":"Miracle","lastName":"Okah","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cebae8fde05b50de4eb6952005c1da27?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}}},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Startups","slug":"startups","categoryId":5}}]},"tags":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Female-founder"}},{"node":{"name":"Founder"}},{"node":{"name":"Startup"}}]}}},{"node":{"title":"Meet Olajumoke Oduwole: Founder of KJK Africa ","excerpt":"<p>She has been trained in entrepreneurship and business management in nine top-notch accelerator programs and enterprise development centres in Africa and Europe.</p>\n","slug":"women-in-tech-olajumoke-oduwole","date":"2024-05-08T07:58:40","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://wp.thestackjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EDA185BF-30ED-418A-826C-07B542D1A034.jpg"}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Miracle Okah","firstName":"Miracle","lastName":"Okah","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cebae8fde05b50de4eb6952005c1da27?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}}},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Founders","slug":"founders","categoryId":4}}]},"tags":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Female-founder"}},{"node":{"name":"Founder"}},{"node":{"name":"Startup"}}]}}},{"node":{"title":"Rose-Margaret Ekeng-Itua has become the first black woman to hold a PhD in Cybernetics","excerpt":"<p>An award-winning Nigerian Professor, Rose-Margaret Ekeng-Itua, has emerged as the first black woman in the world to earn a doctorate (PhD) in Cybernetics, which is the scientific study of control and communication in animals and machines, concerned with understanding complex systems like learning, cognition, adaptation, emergence, communication, and efficiency.
