She tells us about her love for everything design and what the future looks like for her in this journey.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Tell us a little about yourself&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Rae. I’m 24 years old and I graduated from Afe Babalola University with a degree in law in 2019. I currently work as a paralegal at the Ministry of Justice and I am a self-taught designer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Why was it important for you to transition from law into tech?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve always loved design; whether fashion, interior, or graphic design. In uni, I used to make fliers friends for their events, businesses, and more for free. Then I started designing logos for my businesses and one day in 2017, someone asked me to design a logo for her bag brand and I think I charged her N10,000 or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was the first time I had taken money for designing something. I had zero experience in branding and I was scared that I’d mess up but thankfully, I was able to come up with a design she loved, I was so proud of myself when I saw the final results. The logo is still being used today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming out of uni, I wasn’t certain I wanted to practice law, so while waiting for admission to the Nigerian Law School, I decided to focus a little bit more on design and in 2021 after failing a course in my bar finals, I decided that I would build a career in tech, alongside my law career, when I eventually get called to bar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. What career in tech are you specialising in?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Design; graphic, product, brand, and UI/UX. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. How has the transition been so far? Any obstacles? Wins, failures?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been fun, really. And very insightful. I’ve learned so much over the last 6 months about my personal skills and strengths and I know for a fact that I have the potential to be an awesome designer. The one obstacle (or two!) that I currently face is imposter syndrome and the fact that no one wants to hire junior designers; everyone wants a professional with “thirteen years experience” and it’s frustrating because I work best in a defined, controlled environment. However, I am taking the freelance route now. I gotta eat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. What would success in tech look like for you?</h6>\n\n\n\n<p>Overseeing the design of a major product and brand; from the conceptualisation stage to the final launch phase. And also, I want to have a design firm in the near future. It’s already in the works, but I can’t wait to have an elite team of designers. And yes, I’ll be hiring people with zero experience, ready to learn on the job and gain experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. What have you learned in your short time navigating the industry?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t need to know how to code to be in tech. There are so many non-technical roles, especially for people like me who have no interest in the engineering track of tech. Also, copywriting is a very important soft skill for a designer, because more often than not, when designing, you may have to come up with taglines, subtexts, etc. that don’t sound corny and off-topic on the spot. It’s a lot of brainwork but I really enjoy it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Is there anything you know now you wish someone had told you from the beginning?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, I wish I had studied design at university. I feel like I’d be more accomplished, but hey, it’s never too late.&nbsp; You can find Rae on Twitter @raetheelefty, and on Instagram as @raethelefty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a woman in tech and would love to share a story, opinion piece, or anything at all with us, shoot us an email at thestackjournal@gmail.com!
