She talks us through her journey in the tech scene; how she started in cloud engineering before majoring in DevOps, and what she would be doing for money if not tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What&#8217;s your name?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Feyisayo Famakinde.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What do you do?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a DevOps Engineer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why DevOps?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&nbsp;picked DevOps by chance actually.&nbsp;I didn’t want something that involved too much code, but alas I am back to code.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I say it was by chance, it was during the 2020 “period” when I was at home and had nothing to do. I had recently left a job that wasn’t even good in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have always thought I didn’t have the head for tech until one of my best girls started writing codes right in front of my eye.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like &#8220;this thing can’t be that terrible, let me try it&#8221;,&nbsp; so I told people around me and one day my friend forwarded a link for the Google X Andela Scholarship program to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It had Web, Android and Cloud paths and since I didn’t want to code, I chose the cloud path.&nbsp;I watched videos, did various labs and after some projects, we were evaluated for the Google Cloud associate engineer exam voucher, I made the mark.&nbsp;I was so scared while writing the exam but I passed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came the job search o. I even went the extra mile and&nbsp;did the Google IT support course on Coursera just to have foundational knowledge&nbsp;because everything looked like magic but there were no cloud engineering roles in Nigeria, everything Cloud I saw had DevOps in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found that people used more of Microsoft Azure too so&nbsp;I looked into SheCode Africa, lucky for me, that was when the DevOps path was launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did personal projects first but when I started feeling like I was in a loop of only projects, I started messaging managers on LinkedIn for an internship position. By God’s grace, someone gave me a chance and that’s been it since then.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>So does that mean there&#8217;s a difference between DevOps and Cloud Engineering?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a stark difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloud Engineering is knowing how to operate cloud platforms actually, been able to use the services they offer. DevOps itself isn’t really a role, it’s like a culture. A culture of automation, saving time, saving resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DevOps is a whole lot of tooling and processes. But to excel at DevOps these days you need to know Cloud Engineering because most organizations host their services in the cloud these days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>So it means that first off you started in cloud engineering and then you specialized in DevOps right?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Before tech, what was your background?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I studied English in school. I also had a brief stint with digital marketing and then business operations for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How</strong><strong>much coding do you do as a DevOps engineer?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I write YAML for Kubernetes and CI/CD. I am learning python for automation at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How&#8217;s Python?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I am struggling with python at the moment but hopefully, it gets easier</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>In this journey into DevOps, what challenges did you face?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The never-ending learning o. I haven’t finished and there is still more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>And how did you overcome them?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tenacity really. Trying to keep on. Then knowing basics, Once you know the basics, Everything else isn’t all that insurmountable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>So for those of us that are non-tech, describe your job to us.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For DevOps. I would come up with something. DevOps is the process of making code deployment easier and faster and cheaper too. So you are considering a whole lot, the business perspective, the technical and operational perspective together. You are building processes that check your code, build it, test it and deploy it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I<strong>f you didn&#8217;t need to work again and earn money, what would you do for fun?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Travel but I think it would be exhausting. I have to be on my feet though. I don’t think I would change whatever I am doing. I have found out that being active helps me a lot.</p>\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"What Does it Mean to Be a Customer Support Manager?
