Usually, it takes several minutes to wake her up,” Mohammed Rafeeq, Hana&#8217;s father, told&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.khaleejtimes.com/uae/dubai-meet-the-9-year-old-who-got-email-from-apple-ceo-tim-cook-for-developing-an-app\">Khaleej Times.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I felt like a magnet was pulling me up,” an excited Hana told Khaleej Times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/hana\">Hana</a>&nbsp;becomes the youngest iOS app developer. The young girl wrote to Apple&#8217;s CEO about her app and achievement once she was done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cook commended Hana for her outstanding accomplishments for someone so young. He informed the young girl that he believes in her and is confident that she would do great things in the future if she just stayed consistent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Congratulations on all of your impressive achievements at such a young age. Keep at it, and you will do amazing things in the future,” Cook wrote in his response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hana&#8217;s software was built using 10,000 lines of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In case parents are busy with work, they can record stories so that children can listen to it before going to sleep. This will help build the bond between parents and their children,” Hana told Khaleej Times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mohammed claims that Hana, and her sister Leena, age 10, are both self-taught proficient programmers. The daughters looked up to their parents, who both worked in tech. While discussing his daughter&#8217;s upbringing, Hana&#8217;s dad mentioned that he had his own fintech startup in 2018 and had urged his wife to begin taking coding classes. Leena, around age six at the time, developed an interest in coding. Her father, realising that she was still a youngster, handed her a mini-laptop on which to learn HTML and CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leena, Hana&#8217;s older sister, created Lehnas, a website that teaches kids about new animals, colours, and phrases. As Leena&#8217;s home state of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/kerala\">Kerala</a>&nbsp;was experiencing devastating floods, she posted a link to the Chief Minister&#8217;s relief fund. This is when they saw the potential in their daughters. Rafeeq acknowledged that they chose to homeschool the daughters because they felt their skills were not valued at school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ladies study a wide range of languages, including their native <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/malayalam\">Malayalam </a>and computer languages like English, Spanish, Arabic, German, and Hindi.</p>\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Rose-Margaret Ekeng-Itua has become the first black woman to hold a PhD in Cybernetics","excerpt":"<p>An award-winning Nigerian Professor, Rose-Margaret Ekeng-Itua, has emerged as the first black woman in the world to earn a doctorate (PhD) in Cybernetics, which is the scientific study of control and communication in animals and machines, concerned with understanding complex systems like learning, cognition, adaptation, emergence, communication, and efficiency.
